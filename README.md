Colemak keyboard layout for windows 10 with capslock set to escape

Created using a "hacked" MSKLC following the directions [here](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/870-hacked-msklc-to-enable-remapping-capslock/).
The altered `kbd.h` and a MSKLC colemak layout file, which could be used to make more layouts but are not necessary for installing and using this layout, are found in `msklc_files`.

Installation should be as simple as running setup.exe.
